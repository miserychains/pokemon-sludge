Congratulations for this landslide win !
You're seeing this message because you were able to defeat me with at least four of your Pokémons still able to fight, 
but not without sustaining at least one KO or using an item.
#CODE if $battleDataArray.last().playerItemsUsed==0
#CODE Kernel.pbMessage("However, you didn't used any items this time!")

CLOSE_CALL
A pretty close match indeed ! 
I really thought I could win, but you still have three or less Pokémons standing and I have none.

6-0
Woah,you made me look like an amateur there.
I couldn't even land a single KO!
I guess you deserve something for this win.
Also to demonstrate you can do this kind of thing if you want to.
#CODE Kernel.pbReceiveItem(:GARCHOMPITE)

NO_ITEMS
You were able to win without using any items. Very impressive.

LESS_ITEMS_THAN_OPPONENT
You used items during that battle, but not more than I used myself. I suppose this makes us even.

MORE_ITEMS_THAN_OPPONENT
You used a lot of items during that battle. Not a very clean win, but a win nonetheless.
